It considers entropy - that is randomness, uncertainty and variation - all of &#10;which are evident in real life. &#10;A general overview of an experiment &#10;• Aim &#10;• Hypothesis &#10;• Collection of control data &#10;• Collection of experimental data &#10;• Inerpretation and inference of results &#10;Terminology &#10;• Population - the total collection of elements &#10;• Individuals / Units - the elements &#10;• Variable - A quantitative or qualitative characteristic &#10;• Sample - a subset of the population (part of all the data) &#10;Variables &#10;There are two types of variables. &#10;• Qualitative (categorical) - ie gender, hair colour &#10;• Quantitative (numerical) - ie height, age, salary &#10;Note: Some categorical variables may be represented as numeric values - but they are still &#10;categorical values &#10;Sampling - Picking a good sample &#10;If a sample was taken from a population, the sample must be representative of the whole &#10;population. Otherwise the sample data would would be biased, a represent a skewed set of data &#10;that does not accurately reflect the populatiom &#10;To achieve a good sample, random sampling must be performed. &#10;The selection of individuals is based upon a totally random fashion. &#10;Bur wHaT iS rAnDoM &#10;Random is the absence of order. But probably most 'random' outcomes are based on some &#10;complicated pattern we simply just are not aware of &#10;We could, however, scope the sample data if we want statistical analysis of individuals of a certain &#10;criteria, or group. Do keep in mind though, that the information produced does not represent the &#10;entire population, but only that group. (obviously) &#10;Graphical Representation of Data &#10;Any good statistical analysis of data should always begin with plotting of the data &#10;An outlier is an anomaly where a piece of data is extremely different to others. &#10;Dot plot &#10;A dot plot is a summary of numerical data when the data set is small. &#10;Each observation is represented by a dot above its corresponding location on a horizontal scale. A &#10;second occurance of that same value is stacked on top of the dot. &#10;10 11 12 &#10;Minutes To Eat Breakfast &#10;IT'S JUSTA HISTOGRAM &#10;Stem-and-Leaf plot &#10;Each observation is separated into a step (all but last digit) and a leaf (last digit). &#10;All unique stems are written in a vertical column (smallest at the top), and the leaves corresponding &#10;to that stem are written out horizontally (in increasing order) &#10;Stem &#10;4 &#10;5 &#10;6 &#10;7 &#10;8 &#10;9 &#10;10 &#10;Leaf &#10;4679 &#10;34688 &#10;2256 &#10;148 &#10;6 &#10;These sort of plots enable us to observe: &#10;• Identification of a typical value &#10;• Spread of typical values &#10;• Presence of gaps &#10;• Extent of symmetry &#10;• Number and location of peaks &#10;• Presence of outliers &#10;Stem and leaf plots can be modified to achieve extended needs &#10;• Rounding, truncating - simplify detail &#10;• Splitting each stem - further distribution detail &#10;• Back-to-back stem plots to compare two sets of related distributions &#10;Frequency distribution charts, bar graphs, histograms &#10;Yeah eh. &#10;For histograms of numerically continuous data, classes need to be created to group values. These &#10;classes are non-overlapping intervals, each (usually) equal in size. &#10;number of classes — &#10;Terminology- &#10;• symmetric &#10;numberofobservations &#10;• skewed to the leWright - has a left/right tail &#10;• unimodal I bimodal I trimodal I &#10;n peaks &#10;• bell-shaped - symmetrical and unimodal &#10;Class widths do not have to necessarily be equal, as sometimes it is nonsensical. &#10;Density histograms &#10;The area of the a class should be proportional to its frequencies. &#10;Density = relative frequency / class width &#10;Relative frequency = frequncy of the class / total observations &#10;There are actually heaps of different types of graphs that we could use. &#10;Check out this site' &#10;Powered by Hugo I Theme - Even &#10;0 2019 Andrew Wong @5206677) &#10;Next @ "></p>
